# Image-classification-using-CNN
Image classifier using a Python deep learning library (Keras) to classify an input image as one of the trained classes.

This program uses the concept of Convolution Nueral Networks (CNN) to train the model to classify the test image as one of the training set of images.
Here, I have created 2 folders in my local system, called 'training' and 'test', inside of which are 2 folders (binary classification) have pictures of mountains and rivers each.
The CNN trains the model and tests it using the test set of images to give us an accuracy score. This will in turn help us correctly classify our 'test.jpg' as a mountain or a river.
